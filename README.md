# Assignment3
This is Assignment 3 by Jinho Nam for CS 4850 (Foundation of AI) course.

## How to set up the environment
The dependencies for this project are listed in `requirements.txt`. Python virtual environment will install all of the items within the file.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the cloned project directory.
3. Create a Python virtual environment.
    - `python -m venv .venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment.
    - For Linux, `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
    - For Windows, `.\.venv\Scripts\activate\`
5. Install dependencies
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## What code to run
This is the instruction what code to run to get the answers for questions in [PDF file](Assignment3_Description.pdf). If the Python virtual environment and the dependencies are installed succesfully, this instruction will give the result as supposed.

- Question 1
    - `simpleAutoencoder.py` and `Q1.py` are the corresponding files for the answers.
    - For the 2-D plot, refer to the lines 32 and 33 in `Q1.py`.
    - For the 3-D plot, refer to the lines 106 and 107 in `Q1.py`. <br />
    - Example output (2-D plots):
        ![question1-result(2-D)](./results_images/Q1_2-D_scattor_plots.png)
    - Example output (3-D plots):
        ![question1-result(3-D)](./results_images/Q1_3-D_scattor_plots.png)
        >  The output plots are also at [here](./results_images) as .png file.
